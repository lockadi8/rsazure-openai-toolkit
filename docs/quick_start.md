Don't want to deal with virtual environments or manual setup?

Set up your environment with one command:

### ▶️ Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renan-siqueira/rsazure-openai-toolkit/main/scripts/setup.ps1 | iex
```

### 🐧 Linux/macOS (Bash):

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renan-siqueira/rsazure-openai-toolkit/main/scripts/setup.sh | bash
```

This will:

- Create a virtual environment
- Activate it
- Install `rsazure-openai-toolkit`
- Print usage instructions

Ideal for both beginners and experienced developers 🚀
