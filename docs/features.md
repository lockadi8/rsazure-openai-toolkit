## ðŸš€ Key Features

This toolkit was designed with reliability, transparency, and real-world usage in mind:

- âœ… Modular architecture â€” fully structured by domain (`core/`, `cli/`, `env/`, `session/`, `logging/`, etc.), with clean separation of concerns and low coupling
- âœ… CLI-first design â€” `rschat` and `rschat-tools` are powered by `ChatCLI` and `ToolsCLI` classes for clean, extensible logic
- âœ… Intelligent retry mechanism â€” robust error handling with exponential backoff (via `tenacity`)
- âœ… Session context persistence â€” configurable memory window with full history storage (`.full.jsonl`) and safe prompt/config validation (`.meta.json` with backups)
- âœ… Reproducible outputs â€” deterministic generation via `seed`, powered by `ModelConfig`
- âœ… Config utilities â€” includes `get_model_config()`, `ModelConfig`, and tokenizer-aware input token estimation
- âœ… Transparent logging â€” opt-in interaction logging via `InteractionLogger`, supporting both `jsonl` and `csv` formats
- âœ… Smart token tracking â€” full visibility into input, output, and total tokens (with estimation fallback)
- âœ… Designed for testability â€” object-oriented CLI, consistent outputs, and reusable components across scripts and pipelines
- âœ… Secure by design â€” no telemetry, no external data sent, no hidden state or magic behaviors
- âœ… Production-ready â€” suitable for professional, CI/CD-integrated, and auditable environments
